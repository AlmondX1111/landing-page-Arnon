# 🎮 Mario Game Dev | Be Ready for the Next Release: Movie, Games, and Anime Trailers!

Welcome to the **Mario Game Dev** project!  
hat’s Great About My Game
One of the best things about my game is how fun and familiar it feels. Inspired by the classic Mario style, it brings back the excitement of jumping through colorful levels, avoiding enemies, and collecting coins. The controls are simple and smooth, making it easy for anyone to pick up and play, but still challenging enough to keep players engaged.
The level design is creative, with hidden secrets and cool obstacles that make each stage feel fresh. Whether you're dodging tricky traps or bouncing on enemies to reach a higher platform, there's always something exciting to do. Plus, the game has a bright and cheerful look that adds to the fun, making it enjoyable for players of all ages.
If you loved classic platformers, you’ll feel right at home with this game—but with its own unique twists that make it special.
If you want me to include something specific—like your character design, story, or any cool feature—just let me know!
